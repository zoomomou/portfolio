# Final Project Part 1

## Outline

##### Summary

Issue: 
This project is going to focus on telling a story about data on car accidents in the US from 2010 to 2020. In this project, I am interested in first showing the trend of car accidents in the past 10 years and then leading to the issue. The main purpose of this data visualization project is to deliver the issue that there is a rise in the number of death as well as crashes caused by car accidents.

Reason: 
After showing the trend of car accidents in the past 10 years, I will be going into detail about the possible reasons that cause the rise in the number of car accidents. For instance, gender, age, speed, time of the day, as well as distraction can all become the reasons that result in car accidents.

Solution: 
In conclusion, with data visualization, we will be able to identify what are the top three important aspects that cause car accidents, and therefore, we can give a solution to this issue of rising car accidents.

## Method and Medium

I am planning on using Shorthand as the digital platform for this project. I am also going to create a simple version of the project for the presentation. Meanwhile, I am planning on using Tableau as well as Flourish to realize the sketches that I made.
