## Reflection

The major change I made from part II to part III is the detailization of the story. As I received comments for Part II that the story seems abbreviated, and it does not stand on its own without explanation. Therefore, in order to fix this issue, I went ahead and added more transitions as well as elaboration on the ideas that I am trying to make. The elaboration is mostly from my own experience and feeling as a novice driver. 

The target audiences of my story are novice drivers like me, and I believe that I have provided reliable information that guides them to be aware of some bad driving habits they might have. Instead of comparing what people think vs. what data tells us (the main idea for part II), I am narrowing the focus by showing and elaborating on the possible effect of each factor that affects safe driving.


As well, as I looked through the shorthand slides, I found that the color scheme of some of the charts does not align with the content very well. For instance, I replaced all the blue colors with warm colors, to remind and alarm audiences that they should take this topic seriously. Moreover, thanks to Chanaradee for pointing out that some of the texts are hard for people to see as the opacity of my background images are too low. I went ahead and made adjustments to all of the background images, and the texts now seem more clear and readable!

As a further reflection, I think the design of the call to action is something that stood out to me. Compared with part II, I made a lot of changes to the call to action in part III because the previous one is not very specific and actionable, so I made it more detailed so people are able to act right away!
