# About Me

I am a second year MAM student, and finished my undergraduate in Boston. 
I remember taking a color theory class a couple years ago, and I really enjoyed working with color.


# What I Hope to Learn

I am interested in learning the psychology behind color, as well as replace the long and boring data with a clear, brief, and pretty graph! 
I am also eager to learn tools that are helpful for data visualization.
Still making decisions o post-graduate plans, but will travel a lot for sure before start working.
