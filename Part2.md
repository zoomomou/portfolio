##### Other Prep Work: Survey
  
What I hope to find from the survey:

* Is car accident a common thing for everyone
* How important is safe driving to people
* Through first-hand experience, what are the factors that people believe most affect safe driving
* What might cause them to change their driving habits
* Are there any safe-driving measures or methods that people find helpful
* Any other suggestions people have to new drivers
  
Survey Questions:

_*Content Warning: This interview contains sensitive questions that may be harmful or traumatizing to some people._

1. Do you have a driver’s license? If so, how often do you drive?
2. Have you ever been in a car accident? Or is there a car accident that really struck you? Can you briefly describe the situation, if applied?
3. How much of an impact do you think safe driving has on your life?
4. What do you think is the most important factor for safe driving? Why?
5. Can you rank the 6 given factors from most important to least important? Can you explain how you decided on your top three choices? (Seat belt, speeding, distraction, time of the day, age, gender)
6. What kinds of things would cause you to change your driving habits?
7. What advice would you give to someone who drives dangerously? 
8.  What measures have you taken to drive safely? Do you think it has helped?
9. Is there anything else that was not covered in the above question that you would like to share?

## User Research & Interviews


##### Foreword
The target audience of this story is new drivers, and I aim to help them identify the most important factors for safe driving. 
My interviewees vary from male to female, aged 20s to 30s, and new drivers to skilled drivers.
From the interviews, I hope to find out whether my story seems clear to users, whether there is something that is missing that they might want to see, and what they think about the overall design as well as the data visualization design.


##### Interview Script

| Question | Male, 20s | Female, 20s | Male, 30s |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. What story do you think this is about?  | I think the story is about safe driving. | The various reasons for car crashing. | Data on traffic accidents leading to injuries and deaths are interpreted and used to warn readers of the important factors for safe driving. |
| 2. How do you feel about the story, is it convincing? | Yes, it is convincing. The data with specific numbers create a more convincing story to me. | It is lively and the data is convinced！| The presentation of figures and graphics is very convincing. |
| 3. Did you find anything surprising or confusing? | I found that the fact that half of the crash deaths happens between 3pm-12am in 2020 is very surprising. | I am surprised about day dreaming is the biggest part of distraction! | Nothing was confusing, the overall interface is simple and clear. |
| 4. What worked, what didn’t work? What are the things you might do differently? | Many things worked for me except the speeding. I think I would probably produce a graph which relates exact speed with the ratios of deaths and crash if I have enough dataset. | No driving after alcohol and normal weather cause more car accident！I might have different opinion about distraction, sometimes I think that drowsiness is the biggest reason for distraction. | I like the presentation of figures and graphics, but I find the accompanying pictures rather mild and not alarming enough. Consider adding some more tragic accident photos to warn readers. |
| 5. Is there anything else that is missing that you would like to see? | I would like to see if there is any relationship between drivers' age and car crash.  | If someone wear an uncomfortable shoes to drive, such as platform shoes or high heels. | I would like to see some actual cases of tragic accidents, to deepen the impression. |
| 6. How does the overall design look to you? | It looks succinct in total design with concise and direct data for the graphs it contains. | Great! | The overall design is beautiful, the page turns smoothly, and the pictures are consistent. |
| 7. How would you improve the data visualization design? Do they seem to explain the data well? | I think the bar chart and pie chart looks very straight on the points the author wants us to notice. Not coming up with really good advice. | Little confusing about BAC=.00 How about translate alcohol by using drink a little，drunk and no alcohol? | Data visualization design is well done. |
| 8. Do you think beginning drivers would benefit from this story, why? | Surely they will. Those numbers straightly connecting deaths with car crashes due to different reasons will make them be more careful when driving on the road. | Yes! Actually! This story is telling truth! | Novice drivers will benefit from it. This tells the novice driver that even though vehicles are now safer and road conditions are getting better, traffic accidents resulting in injuries and fatalities are happening every day. This story also tells the reader what to do to avoid tragedies. |
| 9. What are some other suggestions you might give? | Maybe we could make the alcohol visualization part more impressive, as this lesson is a very important one for drivers in the USA. | With more horrible pictures, giving beginning drivers a shock! | You can list some special dangerous situations that drivers may encounter on the road, such as accidents caused by scrap tires left on the road after other vehicles have blown out; accidents caused by the sudden appearance of wild animals; accidents caused by accidental tire blowouts, etc. These all put demands on the driver's concentration and stress response. |

##### Findings from interviews:

I noticed that all respondents were able to identify the purpose of the story and found it compelling. No one felt that anything confused them, but the data did surprise most of them, as some of it may have been more exaggerated than they thought.

As for what didn't work, they had almost entirely different answers; for example, one person suggested using more shocking images to deepen the reader's impression. Likewise, the answers differed in terms of what I didn't show that they would have liked to see. I think it depended on their different personal experiences, which made them focus on different aspects.

In addition, I received compliment from all of them in terms of the overall design as well as data visualization design, although I probably need to be clearer on the BAC level. Again, all three interviewees felt that this story would benefit new drivers because I was representing results supported by actual data.

Again, in the last question, most of them mentioned using more shocking images/data visualizations to catch the reader's eye, while one of them mentioned other additional advice I could give to new drivers.


##### Changes I plan to implement:

In terms of the changes I plan to implement, I will consider making the visuals more stunning. For example, I could add more warning images and make some adjustments to the color scheme to make it look more serious.

I will also be making changes to some of the data visualizations to make them look clearer to the reader. For example, adding "did not drink, drank a little, and got drunk" next to the BAC levels will help people understand the data better. Likewise, I will test the data with more chart types to improve the explanation.

In addition, I will include more suggestions in the last slide, and therefore novice drivers can benefit from these additional suggestions.
